<h1>X-Frame-Options and<br>CSP frame-ancestors</h1>

<Transform scale="0.9">

The decoy web page <span class="color:accent">"re-dresses"</span> the UI and <span class="color:accent">hijacks</span> the user's clicks.

This attack is called [clickjacking, aka UI redressing](https://portswigger.net/web-security/clickjacking).

<p>Let's say we are the owners of <code class="link-decoration-none">https://vulnerable-bank.com/transfer.html</code>.</p>

How do we prevent <span class="color:accent">other websites</span> from embedding <span class="color:accent">our website's content</span> into their web pages?

### Yesterday

```txt
# prevents any domain from framing our content
X-Frame-Options: DENY

# allows our site to frame its content
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
```

</Transform>

::right::

<Transform scale="0.9">

### Today

```txt
# prevents any domain from framing our content
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none';

# allows our site to frame its content
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self';
```

The `frame-ancestors` CSP directive offers more flexibility than the `X-Frame-Options` header:

```txt
# allows our content to be framed by these domains
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 
  https://legit-site.org 
  https://another-legit-site.com 
  https://*.legit-site.it
```

The above configuration allows `legit-site.org`, `another-legit-site.com`, `*.legit-site.it` to embed our content in their `<iframe>`, `<embed>`, and `<object>`.

</Transform>

<!--
The `X-Frame-Options` HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a `<frame>`, `<iframe>`, `<embed>` or `<object>`. Sites can use this to avoid clickjacking (aka UI redressing) attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites. With "content" we mean: a HTML document, a video, an image, a PDF file, etc. `<iframe>`, `<embed>` and `<object>` elements. `<iframe>`s are for embedding other web pages, and the other two allow you to embed external resources such as PDF files.

A clickjacking attack can be combined with a CSRF attack. Clickjacking relies on deceiving users into interacting with content that they don't intend to interact with. If the user interaction triggers a cross-site request, the clickjacking attack is basically also a CSRF attack.

If the interaction triggered by clickjacking only affects the same site where the interaction occurred (i.e., a same-origin request), and doesn't involve exploiting the user's authenticated session on another website, then it's not considered a CSRF attack. It remains solely a clickjacking attack.
