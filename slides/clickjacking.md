Clickjacking (aka UI redressing) stands for click hijacking.

The HTML document rendered in the iframe (e.g. https://vulnerable-bank.com/transfer.html) could even be a legit website, but it's rendered in a decoy web page that tricks the user into clicking on a button/link that the user does not see.
