Here is an example of an OWASP community meeting I was at. I was at OWASP Italy Day 2023. I was talking to the guys at the [Contrast](https://www.contrastsecurity.com/ ) and [SecureFlag](https://www.secureflag.com/) booths. I saw how SecureFlag integrates with GitHub and comments your PR when it contains insecure code.
